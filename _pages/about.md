I am Shayhan Ameen Chowdhury, currently a PhD student at Kyung Hee University in Data and Knowledge Engineering Lab. I  also worked as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC) and I have completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh.

I have two and half years of research experience obtained at Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh. The results from my Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Computer Science and Engineering thesis are published in several international journals. I did my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Computer Science and Engineering at International Islamic University Chittagong. I was one of the core members of the university’s leading competitive programing team and participated in several programming contests. One of my significant achievements was the runner-up position in IIUC Inter-University Programming Contest – 2011. Currently, I also volunteer as a judge in several programming contests. My computer language skills are: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PhP and Python. And I also have knowledge of TensorFlow, Keras, fastai and Matlab.

[//]: # (This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template]&#40;https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io&#41; and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages]&#40;https://pages.github.com&#41; is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme]&#40;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/&#41; created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository]&#40;https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io&#41; right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com]&#40;http://stuartgeiger.com&#41;, which uses [this Github repository]&#40;https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io&#41;.)

[//]: # (======)

[//]: # (Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown &#40;.md&#41;, YAML &#40;.yml&#41;, HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages]&#40;https://pages.github.com/&#41; service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.)

[//]: # (Many of the features of dynamic content management systems &#40;like Wordpress&#41; can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one]&#40;https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb&#41; that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk]&#40;https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html&#41;.)
